*Library in progress*

This library has classes and functions that aid in:

- splitting a word into phonemes
- comparing phonemes from pronounced words, with the phonemes in the actual pronunciation of the word
- uses a similarity score to complete the comparison (and tells if the pronunciation is acceptable or not)
(score = 1 -> acceptable; score = 0 -> not acceptable)
